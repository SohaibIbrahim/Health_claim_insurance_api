    "#### Fast-Api\n",
    "- **Middleware.cors (cross origin resource sharing)**:This is used to establish connections from different web addresses like localhost:3000 which would otherwise not be possible for security concerns\n",
    "- **slowapi limiter and ratelimitexceeded** : This is used to put a limit as to how much we can call request at any instance to prevent spamming,ratelimitexceeded throws an error when this limit exceeds\n",
    "- **get_remote address(slowapi)** : used to get the ip address of user to track number of calls made\n",
    "- **ApiRouter** : it helps in organizing routes into local groupsand allows us to split our api accross various files like users.py,claims.py so instead of one giant file,we have a manageable small batch of files"
